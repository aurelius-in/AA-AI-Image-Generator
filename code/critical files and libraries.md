### Critical files and libraries:

#### Python programming language: 
Python installed on the computer to run the code.

#### Machine learning libraries to create the AI image generator: 
##### TensorFlow
##### Keras
##### PyTorch .

#### Image processing libraries to preprocess the input images and generate the output images:
##### OpenCV
##### Pillow
##### Scikit-image 

#### Training data: 
A large dataset of images was used to train the AA AI image generator, obtained from various sources, online image repositories, and our own images.

#### Training code: 
You would need to write Python code that trains the AI image generator using the training data.

##### Image generation code: 
Once the AI model was been trained, I wrote the Python code that generated new images based on the trained model.
