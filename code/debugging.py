import logging

# Python logging module logs debug messages at various stages of the AI image generator. 
# We set the logging level to DEBUG to ensure that we capture all debug messages. 
# We log the test loss and accuracy after evaluating the performance of the model on a validation dataset. 
# We also log the generated images and the actual images in the dataset for comparison to measure accuracy. 
# By using logging.debug() instead of print(), we can easily turn off or filter out these debug messages 
# when we don't need them, making our code more efficient and easier to maintain.

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

model = ...

# Train the neural network using the prepared dataset
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, validation_data=(x_val, y_val), epochs=10, batch_size=32, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the performance of the model using a validation dataset
score = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, batch_size=32, verbose=0)
logging.debug('Test loss: %.4f', score[0])
logging.debug('Test accuracy: %.4f', score[1])

# Generate new images using the trained model
generated_images = model.predict(x_test[:10], verbose=0)

# Compare the generated images to the images in the dataset to measure accuracy
