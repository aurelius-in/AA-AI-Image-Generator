#### Implementation:

To implement the AA AI Image Generator, you will need a dataset of images to train the GAN. Once you have the dataset, you can train the GAN using the following steps:

##### 1. Initialize the generator and discriminator networks.
##### 2. Load the dataset and preprocess the images.
##### 3. Train the discriminator on real and fake images.
##### 4. Train the generator to create images that fool the discriminator.
##### 5. Iterate steps 3 and 4 until convergence.
##### 6. Once the GAN is trained, new images are generated by sampling from the learned latent space and passing the samples through the generator network.

Here's some sample code for training the GAN using the CelebA dataset:

```
import torch
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

from models import Generator, Discriminator

# Load the dataset
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(64),
    transforms.CenterCrop(64),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], std=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5])
])
dataset = torchvision.datasets.CelebA(root='./data', download=True, transform=transform)

# Initialize the generator and discriminator
generator = Generator()
discriminator = Discriminator()

# Set up the optimizers
optimizer_G = torch.optim
```
